## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### ✅ Step 1: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### ✅ Step 2: Install Required Packages

#### Option A: Automatic Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option B: Manual Installation

Use this if `requirements.txt` doesn't work:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install gTTS
pip install playsound
pip install yfinance
pip install pyaudio
```

If you face issues with `pyaudio` (especially on Windows):

```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

> 💡 On macOS: Install PortAudio first with `brew install portaudio` then try `pip install pyaudio`.
